# Power BI

## Discussion Points
1. [What is Power BI Report Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/report-server/compare-report-server-service)  
  Power BI desktop's version on development machine and deployment machine must match
2. What are DataSets?  
   Rememeber: Your Reports -> Datasets -> Data
2. Roles - Role level security  
  -Create role level security using Modeling tab -> Manage Roles. You can visualize it using 'View as Roles' under same tab.  
  -Same report can be seen by multiple stakeholders given right permissions are set. This avoid creation of multiple reports and thus maintenance overhead
3. What are Apps? How do they allow easy experimentation and security around reports?
4. Migration of legacy reports into Power BI

## Sample Data
Download from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/sample-datasets)

## Lab 2
1. Expirement with security aspects in the Power BI Reports created in lab 1
2. Migrate a legacy Power View report to Power BI and find what works and what does not (Limitations of migrated report in Power BI)

1. How do you find your Power BI License information?
2. How do you define and Visualize Roles?
3. What are Apps?
4. How to you import legacy Excel Reports into Power BI?
5. Can you create a report for Power BI Report Server and later deploy it to Power BI Service?
