# Power BI

## Discussion Points
1. [What is Power BI Report Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/report-server/compare-report-server-service)  
  -Power BI desktop's version on development machine and deployment machine must match  
  -This is license with either 1) SQL server Enterprise Edition (with Software Assurance) 2) Power BI Premium
2. Power BI can also be used as self-service sign-up  
  -This is possible for compaines/users without Office 365. A tenant is provisioned when user signs up for just self-service as well
3. Find your license information under My Workspace -> Manage personal storage
4. What are DataSets?  
  -Each report has a dataset behind it. Rememeber: Your Reports -> Datasets -> Data  
  -You can import data from any data source (given connector is available) or "Enter Data" manually  
  -Data in dataset remains as-is unless data refresh happens (Data can be refreshed on Power BI Desktop, Power BI Service or Power BI Report Server or automated)
5. What are dashboards?  
   -Dashboards are created by pinning visual to a new or existing dashboard  
   -Pin between dashboards for easy duplications  
   -What are featured and favourite dashboards?
6. Roles - Role level security  
  -Create role level security using Modeling tab -> Manage Roles. You can visualize it using 'View as Roles' under same tab. 
  -Same report can be seen by multiple stakeholders given right permissions are set. This avoid creation of multiple reports and thus maintenance overhead
7. What are Apps? How do they allow easy experimentation and security around reports?
