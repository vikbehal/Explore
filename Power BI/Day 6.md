# Power BI

## Discussion Points
### Data Modeling  
1. Hierarchies  
  -In Power BI hierarchies enables drill-down into your data  
  -A hierarchy is a set of related fields grouped together  
  -Each level is contained within next level and does not exist independently E.g Country, State, City  
  -Time intelligence: Power BI automatically creates drill-down on date columns for: Year, Quarter, Month, Day  
  -Can also use DAX time intelligence functions to aggregate date for specific time period  
  -Product Lines, Organization, Date, Areas, etc. are all suitable for hierarchies
2. **Demo: Hierarchies**

4. Filters  
  -You can set filters on 1) all pages 2) single page 3) specific visual  
5. **Demo: Filters**  
6. Relationships  
  -Power BI Autodetect feature can recognize relationships, and create them automatically  
  -E.g. In RDBS, it will use schema information (and Primary and Foreign Keys)  
  -E.g. In Excel, it will use column names and information in fields to make guess
