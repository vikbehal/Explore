# Power BI

## Discussion Points
### DAX - Visualizations
1. Types - Charts, Cards, Maps, Tables and Matrices, Tree maps    
#### Charts
- Bar and column charts  
- Line and area charts  
- Line and column charts  
- Funnel charts  
- Scatter charts
- Bubble charts
- Pie charts
- Donut charts
#### Cards
- Cards present most important data first:  
-If users normally read left to right and top to bottom, show most important data in top left  
- Card chart:  
-Display a single numeric value, such as Total Sales  
-Optionally displays data label and title  
- Multirow card chart:  
-Shows multiple numeric values, useful for small datasets, such as Main Category and Total Sales  
-Optionally include the data labels and a chart title  
- KPI  
-Visualize a business objective and show progress towards the goal  
#### Maps
-Microsoft maps use Bing maps technology  
- Map chart  
-Represents data as propotionally sized, color-coded bubbles -Good for data based on cities  
- Filled map chart  
-Uses shading accross a region; darker shades for higher numbers, or rather, high density  
-Useful for demographic data  
- ArcGIC map chat  
-Uses points, areas, clusters, heat maps  
-Can analyze your data against demographic layers  
#### Tables and Matrices  
- Display data in columns and rows  
-Useful for displaying numeric data, such as financials  
-Each numeric column is aggregated  
- Table  
-Best for small datasets  
-Includes very little visual formatting  
-Data must be read to be understood  
-Consumes a lot of space on the report canvas  
- Matrix  
-Can add rows, columns, and values  
-Can enable drilldown  
#### Tree Maps



## Tips  
1. [ersi's](https://www.esri.com) is a good place for getting inspiration for geographical chats  
2. Filled maps which  takes the shape of geographic area e.g. each state of U.S. are called Chroropleth  
3. Matrix typically has dynamic columns and rows, whereas table has fixed columns
