# Power BI

## Discussion Points
1. Roles - Role level security (RLS)  
  -Create role level security using Modeling tab -> Manage Roles. You can visualize it using 'View as Roles' under same tab  
  -Same report can be seen by multiple stakeholders given right permissions are set. This avoid creation of multiple reports and thus maintenance overhead  
  -Combine with USERNAME() function and table relationships to create dynamic securituy rules  
  -RLS requires Power BI Pro license
2. What are Apps? How do they allow easy experimentation and security around reports?  
  -Apps are packaged reports, dashboards and datasets  
  -Share with other Power BI users  
  -Customize for different users  
  -Add title, description and image/logo  
3. Working with Excel in Power BI  
  - Connect and use contents as data  
  -Data must be formatted in columnar manner is Excel  
  -Can use worksheets or Excel tables
  - Import entire workbook, including reports and exports as if you were in Excel Online 

## Sample Data

## Lab 3
1. Import data from Excel and make sure data-types are correctly formatted
2. Try RLS on your Power BI Desktop
3. Find how to deploy apps on MS Teams

## Reflect after lesson or lab
1. What are Apps?  
2. How to enabled last refresh time on tiles? What is the significance of it?  
3. What is RLS? What is the significane of it?  
4. What is it important to format data while importing data from files?
